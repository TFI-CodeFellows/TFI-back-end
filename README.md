## Introduction

M3rcado is a web 3.0 inspired application that simulates a decentralized application running on blockchain technology.

It also simulates the use of ethereum gas to facilitate e-commerce transactions of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated.

NFTs represent real-world items like artwork and real estate.
